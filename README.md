# AgeCalculator
AgeCalculator can be used to calculate the age (in a format of years, months, and days) between two dates. This calculator will include the leap years into its calculations and reflect the outcome accordingly. The calculation will treat Feb 29 in a leap year as Feb 28 in non-leap year.
